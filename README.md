# InfraPy
InfraPy is a modular Python library for infrared image analysis, with a strong foundation in thermography and thermoelastic stress analysis (TSA). It provides a clean and extensible structure for processing, analyzing, and visualizing infrared data, while remaining open to future expansions beyond TSA and classical thermography.
